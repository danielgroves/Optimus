# Optimus

On the fly image optimisation experiment

[![Build Status](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/danielgroves/Optimus.svg?token=4WAX7ZyubP4HC9xzhvPn&branch=master)](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/danielgroves/Optimus)

Optimus was written as a wrapper for ImageMagick to experiment with generating image renders on-the-fly. I concluded this not to be performent enough for my use case, [documented my approaches on my website](https://danielgroves.net/development/2016/05/responsive-images/) afterwards. 

This is not production ready, but I will happily except pull requests. 

The test suit is rather fragile - something with I do acknoledge, and would handle should I continue development towards a production system. I commented on this in commit [31638a](https://github.com/danielgroves/Optimus/commit/31638a75301ab6e8e4444d946221149e1d7aeb8b).
